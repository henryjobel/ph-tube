                    <p class="py-6 font-semibold"></li>The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in the code. There are three types of variable scopes in JavaScript: Global scope: Variables declared outside of any function have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including other functions.
                      Function scope: Variables declared inside a function have function scope. They can only be accessed from within the function itself.
                      Block scope: Variables declared within a block of code, such as a if statement or a for loop, have block scope. They can only be accessed from within the block.
                      The keywords var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The scope of a variable declared with var is function scope. The scope of a variable declared with let is block scope. The scope of a variable declared with const is also block scope.</p>

                    <p class="py-6 font-semibold"></li>The null and undefined values are used in JavaScript to represent the absence of a value.

                      Null: The null value is used to represent the intentional absence of a value. For example, you can use null to represent a missing value in an object or an array.
                      Undefined: The undefined value is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. For example, a variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined..</p>

                    <p class="py-6 font-semibold"></li>
                      REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for creating APIs that are lightweight, scalable, and easy to use. REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol and use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources.
                      
                      The main principles of REST are:
                      
                      Resource identification: Each resource in a REST API is identified by a URI.
                      Resource manipulation: Resources can be manipulated using HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
                      Self-descriptiveness: The meaning of a resource and its operations should be self-describing in the URI and the response payload.
                      Uniform interface: All resources and operations should be accessed using the same HTTP methods and response formats.
                      Layered system: REST APIs can be layered to create a hierarchy of resources.
                      Statelessness: REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request must contain all the information necessary to process it.
                      REST APIs are widely used in the development of web applications and cloud-based services. They are a popular choice for APIs because they are easy to understand and implement, and they are scalable and efficient.
                      
                      Here are some examples of REST APIs:
                      
                      The GitHub API allows you to access information about GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests.
                      The Google Maps API allows you to get information about places, directions, and traffic.
                      The Stripe API allows you to process payments.
                      The Twilio API allows you to send and receive text messages.
